姜央This is the
Nansha Bridge.#小苗Is it special?#姜央It's the strongest
bridge!#姜央My siblings must be
dying to get it.#小苗Then, let's go get them.#姜央Wait, I found a strange
piece of paper in my
pocket...#小苗Why are you changing
the subject?
Are you afraid?#姜央Me? Afraid?
Of course not!#姜央Here, you can have
this paper.#小苗This is ancient
sheet music.#姜央I told you I'm great!
That's a great gift!#小苗I'm taking it to
Jiang Song.#
