姜颂 I... I seem to remember!... Yes! #唱跳 #姜颂If it was in the past#姜颂Jiang Yang was clever and cunning.#姜颂He has a good idea#姜颂The bamboo tube was placed on his fingers#姜颂Collide with bamboo tubed by his hand#姜颂Bamboo tubes clattered against each other#姜颂The bamboo tube was placed on his fingers#姜颂He tapped the bamboo tube#姜颂Sounded like the bridge shuddered and clattered#唱完 #姜颂The lyrics are like this. #小苗So that's it! The lyrics say, "Collide with bamboo tubed by his hand"#小苗I need to find a way to get this bamboo tube#姜颂Yes, go and look for the materials. #姜颂Please give them to me when you find them#
