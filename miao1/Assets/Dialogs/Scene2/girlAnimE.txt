Flowers on my clothing
All dressed up, waiting
Am I waiting for you?
The swallow shakes its head
Raindrops fall
The river overflows
Water engulfs me
Flowers and weeds sprout
His eye found me
But I do not see him
The fish
They fall in love instantly
Is it you?
The moon does not answer
I want to fly
I want to know
Where is he?
The Bird of Fire spreads its wings
The sun on its back
Staring at me
The flames burn everything
Vines crawl up my body
Is it you?
The fish does not answer
