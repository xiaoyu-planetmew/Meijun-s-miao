姜颂The mother butterfly laid the eggs#姜颂Incubating was undertaken by the divine bird#姜颂The divine bird sat on the eggs#姜颂For three whole years#姜颂Three times the seasons went by#姜颂And the eggs hatched#姜颂Jiang Yang was born between the tiger and dragon hours#姜颂But he was late because he wanted to sleep in#姜颂Thunder God was born in the hour of rabbit#姜颂River Dragon at the hour of dragon#姜颂The tiger hatched the next morning at tiger hour#姜颂And the snake at next serpent hour#姜颂These are the lyrics.#
