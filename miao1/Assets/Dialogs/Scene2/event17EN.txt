Tell me about it#小苗Will you  help Jiang Yang to establish a new natural order?#雷公Girl,  I forgive your rudeness for being so young, but I won't take that conceited megalomaniac as my big brother. Shut up, hand over the gong, and I'll let you go.#小苗You,as a God, should be reasonable in your words. Are you going to rob me?#雷公Reasonable? Well, I was born a few hours earlier than Jiang Yang, and I was supposed to be big brother!#姜央Big brother has great responsibility,he should be th Most capable person.
