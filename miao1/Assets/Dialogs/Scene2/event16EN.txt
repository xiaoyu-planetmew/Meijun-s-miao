姜颂 (Thought for a while) I... I seem to remember!... Yes! (Dancing and singing)#唱跳I don't want you to be big brother#I want to be big brother and you won't#Everyone competes to be big brother#A thousand curses at each other#A thousand knives at each other#Brothers do not meet#Sisters do not meet#If in the past#The Dragon King got a treasure on his nose#The Dragon King dived into deep water#Lei Gong got a precious gong#Lei Gong flew into the sky#唱跳 #姜颂The lyrics are like this.#小苗So that's it! The lyrics say, "The Dragon King got a treasure on his nose" "Lei Gong flew into the sky", it seems that one is in the water, one is in the sky!#姜颂Yeah, I've been saving these two things for a long time, and it's time to put them to good use.
