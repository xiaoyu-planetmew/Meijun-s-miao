姜颂I... I seem to remember!... Yes!#唱跳#姜颂 Meibang will not hatch when she lays eggs#姜颂The bird JiYu incubates the eggs#姜颂Eggs are warm when JiYu incubates eggs#姜颂Young are born after more time to incubate#姜颂They were incubated for three years#姜颂Three winters to winter#姜颂Jiang Yang was born in the period of the day from 3 a.m. to 9 a.m.#姜颂He woke up but wouldn't get out of bed#姜颂Lei Gong was born in the period of the day from 5 a.m. to 7 a.m.#姜颂The Dragon was born in the period of the day from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m.#姜颂The Tiger was born in the period of the day from 3 a.m. to 9 a.m the next day.#姜颂The Snake was born in the period of the day from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m the next day#唱完 #姜颂The lyrics are like this. #小苗I see. #小苗God bird that gives these eggs their warmth#小苗Where is God's bird?#姜颂Come sing with me.#姜颂Then God bird will come.#小苗Yes.
