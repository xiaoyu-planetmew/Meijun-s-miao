姜颂The greatest of them all#姜颂You wanted to be#姜颂And so did them all#姜颂They cursed each other#姜颂They slashed each other#姜颂Brothers divided#姜颂Sisters parted#姜颂Long ago#姜颂River Dragon got a crystal ball#姜颂It took him to the deepest water#姜颂Thunder God got a gong#姜颂That took him to the highest sky#姜颂These are the lyrics.#
