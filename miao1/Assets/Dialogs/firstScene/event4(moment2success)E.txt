2Yes, I remember!#23 #2 #2Thousands of seeds were eastward#2Hundreds of seeds were eastward#2All was in the east of the skies#2In the house of abundance#2Afraid the seeds will escape#2FuFang wrapped the house with thorny vines#2And NiuXiang accidentally set fire#2The seeds cried and screamed#2The house was in chaos#2How was NiuXiang able#2To get hold of fire?#2By splitting the roots of the fir tree#2And grinding them with vines?#2If it were Jiang Yang#2He would strike the flint#2And let the sparkles fall#2On the brush close by#2That is how he will get fire#2 #24These are the lyrics.#1Okay!#1It said,
  "He would strike
   the flint#1まずは火打石を
探してみます。#1I will look for a flint.#2Be careful, my child.#
