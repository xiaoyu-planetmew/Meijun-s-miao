2Yes, I remember!
#23 #2 #2When planting seedlings#2Remember to bury with straw#2Remember to bury with wintergreen#2When planting maple seeds#2Make sure to plant bamboo nearby#2Bamboo and maple grow together#2Maple will be surrounded by green#2Maple and bamboo will be friends#2As it reaches for the stars#2With pure green at its feet#2Once planted#2Maple will grow every day#2Straight to the sky#2Breaking clouds and letting in the sun#2Thousands of ridges will have shade#2Thousands of valleys will be cooled#2 #24These are the lyrics.#2The song said that
maple and bamboo
grow together.#2It also said it needs 
straw and wintergreen.#2I have the seeds for
straw and wintergreen.#16Thank you!
Let's plant them.#2We shall go to
the bamboo forest.#27 #
