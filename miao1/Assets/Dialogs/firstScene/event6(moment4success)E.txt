2Yes, I remember!#23 #2 #2The earth has been plowed#2The ground is flat like a rug#2As even as the granary floor#2Ready to be sown with seeds#2The ideal land is#2By a pond#2Water by morning#2Nutrients by night#2Maple seeds shall rejoice#2 #24These are the lyrics.#15The ground is shaking!

What's happening?!#2Please go take a look.#
