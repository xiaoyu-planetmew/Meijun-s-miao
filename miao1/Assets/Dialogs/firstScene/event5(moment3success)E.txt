2Yes, I remember!
#23 #2 #2A maple seed#2Glows golden#2A pine seed#2Wears deep red#2A seed of cedar#2Is grey like ash#2The seeds are here#2What lies beyond#2All the seeds#2But the soft tender seedlings#2Of the Zhe tree#2In a row of five or six#2And beyond them#2What is there#2A gathering of bamboo#2Its yet green shoots#2 #24These are the lyrics.#1Okay!#1The color of the seeds
sounds like a clue.#2Be careful, my child.#
