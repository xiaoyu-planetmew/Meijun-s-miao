2Yes, I remember!#23 #2 #2Because it is now#2Hundreds of trees grow on the hills#2Hundreds of vines cover the valley#2And the ridges wear lush green#2Because it is now#2We need no words to tell the view#2But in ancient times#2Thousands of seeds were eastward#2Hundreds of seeds were eastward#2All was in the east of the skies#2In the house of abundance#2 #24These are the lyrics.#1Okay!#1The song said,
  “All was in the east
   of the skies#1In the house of
   abundance”#1I'll start by
going east.#2Be careful, my child.#
