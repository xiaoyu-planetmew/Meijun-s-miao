1Sir, are you okay?#2Little Miao,
I have been waiting
for you.#1How do you know
my name!?#1Who are you?#1Why were you waiting
for me?#2No need to worry.#2I am Jiang Song,
a songster.#2You are in Jiang Yang's
memory.#1Jiang Yang?#1Jiang Yang is
the originator of
our people, the Hmong.#2That's right.#2Our sacred maple tree
has died.#2It will no longer protect
our homeland.#2We must find a new
sacred maple seed
and plant it.#2Jiang Yang said he chose
you for this mission.#2He told me to wait
for you here.#1Really?
Jiang Yang chose me?#1What do I need to do?
How can I find the maple
seed?#2Apologies...#2I have been waiting here
for so long.#2I have trouble recalling...#1Oh no, what should I do?#2Do not worry, my child.#2Singers store memories
in songs.#2If you sing to me Hmong
songs, they will help me
remember.#1Sing?#1That won't be a problem
at all!#1All Hmong women can
sing beautifully.#2There should be
ancient sheet music
in this village.#2Please find them
and sing them for me.#
